## General Information
- This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes using various factors such as weather, season, and holidays, based on a dataset from a US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes.
- The background of this project is based on the recent decrease in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and BoomBikes wants to prepare for a post-pandemic surge in bike-sharing demand.
- The business problem addressed by this project is understanding the factors that significantly influence bike demand and using this information to develop business strategies that cater to customer needs.
- The dataset used includes daily bike rental data from 2018-2019, along with factors such as weather conditions, season, working days, and holidays. 
- The target variable is the total bike rental count (`cnt`).


## Conclusions
- Whether the data is from year 2018 or 2019-registered a significant impact on the demand of bike, increasing from 2018 to the year 2019.
- The seasonality factor is gigantic, and demand is always higher during Fall and Winter compared to Spring.
- Inconvenient weather like heavy rain and snow significantly reduces the number of users demanding shared bikes.
- The months with lower demands for bikes are April, November, and December, which is in contrast to September, believed to have higher demands arising.
